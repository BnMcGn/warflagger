Ready to help make the internet a more accurate place? Read this quick guide to start posting.


## Getting started

To participate in WarFlagger debates and discussions you will need a username. WarFlagger uses OAuth single sign-on, so you can use your account from Google, Twitter or a few other providers. The complete list is on the [signup page](http://warflagger.net/clath/login).

Once signed in, you will be asked to choose a username.

Now you may proceed to creating an opinion. If you wish to respond to a target that is already on WarFlagger, you may click the `Reply` button on that target. 

Otherwise click on [Write an Opinion](http://warflagger.net/opinion/). There you will need to supply the URL of the page that you wish to target. (For a more convenient option, try the [WarFlagger Bookmarklet](http://warflagger.net/bookmarklet/))

WarFlagger will attempt to load the text of the target into the box on the right of the opinion page. Once this is done you may wish to indicate an Excerpt from the target's text. This can be done by typing the excerpt into the excerpt box or by selecting the text with your mouse. 

Next select the Flag. Like or Dislike are safest when starting out. Visit the [Flags](http://warflagger.net/flags/) page to learn about other flag options.

Select a VoteValue. For now, use 1 with Like and -1 with Dislike.

Fill out the optional Comment field, if you wish.

Click `Post` to finish.
