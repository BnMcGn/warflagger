## Getting started

WarFlagger uses social login. You can sign in with your account from Google, Reddit, Github, Stack Exchange or Twitter. Next, choose a username.

Go to the discussion that you wish to join. The header of each target or opinion will have a **Reply** button. Click it to reply to the whole target. To reply to a specific section, select the text with your mouse. The **Reply** button will now read **Reply to Excerpt**. Click the button.

Start by selecting the Flag. **Like** or **Dislike** are safest when starting out. Visit the [Flags](http://warflagger.net/flags/) page to learn about other flag options.

Select a VoteValue. For now, use 1 with Like and -1 with Dislike.

Fill out the optional Comment field, if you wish.

Click **Post** to finish.
