## Welcome to Warflagger

Hi friends,

Thank you for participating in the warflagger project beta.

## General

### What is warflagger?

Warflagger is an attempt to tame acrimonious debate on the internet. It takes inspiration from user moderated sites such as slashdot, stackexchange and reddit.

### How does it differ from other forum software?

The [Other Sites](https://github.com/BnMcGn/warflagger/wiki/Other-Sites) section of the WarFlagger Wiki has a comparison with other forum sites.


## Usage

### What flags are available in OpinML?

They can be found [here](/flag_descriptions/) with descriptions.

### What is the reference field for?

Like target, reference is meant to hold an URL. Unlike target, it is optional. Use it to connect something to a target link. 

Examples: 

- If you wish to flag an opinion as **Redundant**, it's a good practice to link to the post that the opinion duplicates.
- When replying to a **NeedsReference** request, you can put an answering URL in the reference field, especially if you are leaving the comment field blank.
- The reference field is mandatory when using the **SameThing** flag to merge two discussions.

## Future

### Can OpinML be used for scientific peer review and research?

Possibly. This would require investigation by people familiar with the needs of the scientific community.

### Can Warflagger be used in place of the legal system for trying cases and evaluating evidence?

While it's goals are analogous to some things in the court system, OpinML is not intended for any such use. For one, it will take significant effort to work out all the possible methods of subversion and causes of inaccuracy in OpinML evidence. Perhaps it will some day provide the inspiration for a legal evidence markup system.

### What other possible uses do you forsee for Warflagger/OpinML?

Citizen reporting and media verification. The **EyeWitness** and **SecondHand** flags were made with this use in mind.

### What features do you plan to add in the future?

- A user definable filtering system. You should be able to specify what users you respect on what issues. Ie. You might find that for UserA you want to see what he flags **Interesting**, but that he is being too picky about **Inflammatory** or **Obscene**. Perhaps he is filtering for his children. Yet when UserB says **Obscene**, you know you don't want to see it. You should be able to select who you are going to respect and how you are going to respect them. User filters should be shareable, so that I can, for example, switch over to my opponents' viewpoint and see how they are seeing the accumulated facts. This should also allow curated collections of opinions to be made by trusted community members.
- Browser extensions that show you if a page has opinions attached, and whether serious debate is raging about its content. Also the possibility of viewing the whole web with OpinML highlighting overlaid on it.
- Some form of trust network, perhaps based on [FOAF](http://foaf-project.org/) to cut down on sockpuppeting
