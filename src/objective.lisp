;; What do we need to know about opinions/ rooturl?
;; - what flags have been applied to target by whom?
;; - what opinions count for conversation?
;; - displayableness of opinion
;;   - summary only?
;;   - does it have a comment (once directives are subtracted)?
;; - outgoing references
;; - do we have all opinions?
;; - what opinions apply to the text?
;; - what opinions apply to the title?
;; - how to handle opinions down the tree? Say a disagree to a side type of flag?
;;   - maybe a separate category for guesses... Could make quite a difference to a discredited flag if
;;     someone reputable reinforces it.
;;   - different algos may treat differently.
;; - some stuff from the existing summarizer?
;; - rooturl text info should be included.
;; - Three opinion trees
;; - qualifies as a question or list of things?
;; - direction stuff is objective, right?
;; - replies total/immediate might be subjective... or should we not? Count of hidden.
